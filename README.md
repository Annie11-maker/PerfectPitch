### **MISSION STATEMENT** 
***************************************************************************************************************************

Deliver a lasting and growing legacy for and on behalf of the Le Wagon Community.

### **VISION**
***************************************************************************************************************************

Pitch Perfect vision is to be an open-source platform that will ultimately enable every Le Wagon student to find a safe space to contribute and practice their skills during and post Bootcamp with peer support from the alumni community. 

If successful it is hoped it could provide a platform for them to actively contribute to the Le Wagon #pay-forward initiative and to our Teachers who have given us such exceptional value and knowledge.

It is **not** intended to be a finished product but one that is left to the community to utilize and grow.
