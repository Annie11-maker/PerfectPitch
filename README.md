### **MISSION STATEMENT** 

**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Deliver a lasting and growing legacy for and on behalf of the Le Wagon Community. 

**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

### **VISION**

**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Pitch Perfect vision is to be an open-source platform that will ultimately enable every Le Wagon student to find a safe space to contribute and practice their skills during and post Bootcamp with peer support from the alumni community. 

If successful it is hoped it could provide a platform for them to actively contribute to the Le Wagon #pay-forward initiative and to our Teachers who have given us such exceptional value and knowledge.

It is **not** intended to be a finished product but one that is left to the community to utilize and grow.

**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
** PLEASE NOTE: The below instructions are mandatory for the duration of the project. Any delays will result in Critical Path Delays. **

3. Achievable: Yes - Timeframes, TA Support, Team Skills, Knowledge, and Experience make it feasible. No major concerns were noted. 

4. Realistic: Yes - Team Pitch Perfect is capable of delivering this objective as demonstrated by the Air BnB Project.

### **REMEMBER: The purpose of the projects is for everyone to learn. Teamwork Makes the Dream Work. Embrace Failure, for it is the stepping stone to success.** 

**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

**How to Branch - Feature Branching**

**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

1. Each branch is one feature or part of one feature. Ideally, you should not be working on the same branch for more than a day. 
2. If the backend and basic front end are done, push it and then create a new branch to finish beautifying the view. 
3. Your branch should have a clear, descriptive name, like restaurants-show or dashboard-page-front-end or animated-menu-items.

**NOTE: This also means we never code on master**

1. If you realize you’ve accidentally been coding on Master, don’t fret! 
2. Just move into an existing branch or create a new one, and the uncommitted changes will be brought along with you. 
3. You can review the git flow here.
4. If for some reason you’re having issues moving into a new branch, please open a ticket.

It’s normal to have merge conflicts every now and then, minimize the risk by pushing and merging on a regular basis!

**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

**Continuous Deployment**

**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Once you think you’ve finished your feature, the process should be:

Push your branch - ask one team member to review
Merge into master - if your code is approved by the team
Communicate to the team that the master was updated - so they can pull the latest version
Deploy to Heroku - crash test / debug
Update the Kanban board

Production Best Practice

1. Every time a PR gets merged into the master, the master branch should then be pushed to production
2. This prevents technical debt from stacking up
3. Helps find any bugs right away - you’ll know that they came from the most recent code that was pushed
4. This makes it much easier to find the source and to debug
5. The code is in the hands of the user quicker
6. This also means that you’ll receive any user feedback sooner
